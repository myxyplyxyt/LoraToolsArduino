# Introduction

LoRa radio uses spread-spectrum techniques to communicate in the 915MHz band in the US.  It is used too in the 868MHz band in Europe.  Like bluetooth, LoRa consumes little power, but has a longer range, depending upon power and antenna used.

It is useful for such things as perimeter security devices, packet radio communication, tracking, and internet of things applications.

This eBook describes software developed for the Adafruit SAMD M0 Lora Board, using the Arduino IDE with RadioHead Library.  That processor board with radio are available for purchase at adafruit.com.  The boards are pictured and links given to complete technical information at adafruit.com.

Software modules developed for this eBook are:  Lora ping, lora repeat, arduino-lora terminal,  and bluetooth-lora bridge applications.  The architecture and/or design of each of the software modules is described in a section of this book.

Original source code written for the applications is included in the Appendix. Suggestions are given for building the hardware and software modules in the Arduino environment using Adafruit and RadioHead libraries. Are also supplied are hints for testing and debugging the modules.
 
The information in this book is most suitable for Arduino-familiar hobbyists and engineers, who want to gain hands-on experience with the LoRa radio technology and an Atmel SAMD M0 Arduino compatible board with an on-board Semtech Lora radio, using a RadioHead Arduino driver.

## Hardware Summary

The processor boards used for the lora programs are the **Adafruit Feather M0 with RFM95 LoRa Radio - 900MHz** and the **Adafruit Bluefruit LE UART Friend - Bluetooth** from the same vendor.

The processor board can charge its own battery when connected to USB.

## Development Tool Summary

The Arduino build environment, once you get past setting up a serial port, is more user friendly and easier to use than the Nordic NRF52 build environment, or Visual Studio Code.  Nevertheless, the usual problems with configuration and setup require patience and determination to get through.

Projects do not need make files or elaborate configuration dialogs; but it is necessary to see that the proper board support libraries are loaded.  Adafruit learning modules give helpful clues for finding your way through the setup procedures.

The Arduino environment does not support breakpoints, but does provide serial
output to the its serial monitor for outputting data in support of debugging.
