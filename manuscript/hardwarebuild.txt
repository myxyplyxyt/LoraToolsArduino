# Building The Hardware

## Adafruit’s Atmel SAMD M0 Lora Radio Board ##

It doesn’t get any simpler than this.  The only necessary modification to the board from Adafruit was to add an antenna and battery. An antenna composed of 8.2cm of jumper wire can be soldered into the wire antenna hole at one end of the board.  Unless you are good at soldering antenna sockets, the jumper wire antenna is your best bet.

A LiPoly battery such as that available from Spark Fun or Adafruit can be plugged into the battery charger port.

The loraPing, loraRepeat, and loraTerminal apps run on this board.

## LoraBridge Breadboard ##

Solder headers onto the loraRadio board, and the bluetooth friend board.  The bluetooth friend board comes from the facdtory configured to work as a UART talking at 9600 baud with hardware handshaking.  The Adafruit bluetooth friend page at adafruit.com has instuctions on how to use other builtin functions of the board.

Add six jumpers between the two boards.  The jumpers go between:

{line-numbers=off}
~~~~~~~~
     loraRadioBoard              loraFriendBoard
         TX1---------------------------RX0
         RX0---------------------------TX1
         RTS(11)-----------------------CTS
         CTS(12)-----------------------RTS
         3V----------------------------GND
         GND---------------------------VIN

## LoraBridge Portable ##

This board was put together for range testing.  It consists of the same two boards and jumpers as the breadboard, but jumper connections are made directly between the two boards.

A plastic envelope or credit card case works to carry the bridge boards around, while the Adafruit Blufruit iPhone app can be used to communicate through the bridge with a remote lora board.  For range testing, the remote lora board can be either a repeater or a pinger.

If you have a collaborator, you can communicate remotely with him or her via the lora terminal app running on the arduino development program.
